# selfscript
Scripting in D by using D

# What it does 
Compile and load D code at runtime. 
This allows D to be used as a scripting language for applications written in D

# Dependency
It needs a d compiler in the system path (dmd!). 

# How to use 
The most minmal program ist the main I used for testing. Its under selfscript/ext/selfhost.d 
Just mixin and get started 

# How stable is this?
No idea. This is an idea i had on a friday evening. Maybe ill continue and work on it, maybe not. 
I hope i can make use of it for my Dragon2D project.
